# Programming1_final_project
This is the final project for my programming 1 class. It is a basic hangman game using C++.

User Guide:

To play this Hangman game, you need to download the main.cpp file provided in this repository and you will need to download an IDE (integrated development environment) if you don't have one installed yet. Some popular IDEs for C++ are CLion and VScode. Once you've downloaded and IDE, you will need to install a compiler, MinGW (especially if you're using VScode). CLION may have a compiler packaged with the IDE, but as a general rule download MinGW.

Once MinGW is installed, you're ready to run the main.cpp file that you downloaded from this repo. To run the program, find the run option in your IDE of choice and it will output the game in the terminal and you will be able to play the game. No other steps are needed to successfully compile an run this project.


No input data is needed, as a list of words is imbedded into the program. To change this list of words, you will need to access the  "void playGame()" function of the program and manually change the words in the string vector that holds the list of words:
